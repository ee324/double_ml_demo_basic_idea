<h3>Double Machine Learning Demo</h3>

This repository contains a demonstration of the Double Machine Learning (DML) approach for causal inference using the diabetes dataset from sklearn.

Traditional machine learning (ML) techniques are excellent at making accurate predictions but they often fall short when it comes to identifying the cause-effect relationships that underlie those predictions. 

A key reason for this is 'regularization bias' - a kind of error introduced when machine learning models are simplified to prevent overfitting, but which can distort our estimates of cause-effect relationships.

However, there's a way to correct for this bias using what's called a 'double ML' method.

This involves creating an additional prediction model (hence the 'double') which helps us adjust for the bias in the original model. 

To do this, we take the original prediction model, then use the additional model to form what's called an 'orthogonal score', which helps us adjust the estimates from the original model and correct for the regularization bias.

Finally, to avoid overfitting in this process, we use a technique called 'cross-fitting', which involves splitting the data into different parts (or 'folds') and using some parts to train the model and others to test it.

This 'double ML' approach allows us to use a wide variety of machine learning techniques - like random forests, neural networks, and others - to both make accurate predictions and understand the underlying cause-effect relationships.

Hereâ€™s a simplified version of how Double Machine Learning might be implemented in Python using numpy, pandas, and sklearn. 

<h5>Ways to expand on this very basic demo</h5>

Double Machine Learning is a two-step procedure where:

1. Residuals are obtained by predicting both the treatment and outcome using their respective models.
2. The causal effect is estimated using the residuals.

This code is super basic, just for intro purposes. There are a couple of things to keep in mind and modify in this basic code example:

<ul>
<li><b>Cross-fitting</b>: The code does not use cross-fitting. In Double ML, to avoid overfitting, you usually split the training set further (e.g., into K folds). Then, for each fold, you predict the treatment and the outcome using models trained on the other K-1 folds. This avoids using the same data for both the first and second stages, reducing the risk of overfitting. Implementing cross-fitting would make the approach more in line with the standard DML procedures.</li>
<li><b>Treatment and Control groups</b>: This approach assumes a continuous treatment (RM). If the treatment were binary (e.g., treated vs. not treated), you'd typically model both groups separately and then compare them.</li>
<li><b>Model Flexibility</b>: Using linear regression is okay, but the power of DML comes from its ability to incorporate more flexible machine learning models (like random forests, gradient-boosted trees, neural networks, etc.) for both treatment and outcome prediction.</li>
</ul>

There are Python libraries such as EconML which provide off-the-shelf implementations of DML. Consider using them for more robust and comprehensive solutions.

In conclusion, there are plenty of ways to augment this code, go for it! Reach out if you have any questions.
